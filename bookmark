- does it work w/ if-always inside the local-action-file, instead of modifying it in the workflow file?
- get a "workflow" version of job(s) statuses to work
- exampels of compsite workflows
- Try to stale-ify PRs
- https://github.com/actions/stale

    steps:
    - uses: actions/stale@v3
      with:
        repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        stale-issue-message: 'Stale issue message'
        stale-pr-message: 'Stale pull request message'
        stale-issue-label: 'no-issue-activity'
        stale-pr-label: 'no-pr-activity'


TODO:
- workflow which notifies based on all previous executions, and reports on those statuses
- test all the chimeras
- anchor preprocessing (good solution for reusing all steps in the 3 jobs for supporting ticket-deployments)
    - format: wf-name.yaml.anchored
    - ".gh/steps-profiler/"
    - manual trigger for ticket-deployments, first (parameterized with a branch)
    - probably take out a lot of crap job steps
        - migrate these to an "tester" directory under .gh; with different jobs as a sort of "profiling"
    - will be more apparent how important it is to figure out a preprocessing system once the workflow ap is drafted
