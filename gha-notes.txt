- cron is flaky (every 2 minutes takes ~8 minutes to run)
    > better to use workflow dispatch as a debugging-alternative for it
- jobs, run are not actual contexts
- github is, by far, the most useful (diverse) context
    - including: github.event_name, .event, .repo
- If a key, such as to: ${{ ... }} evaluates to null (because the secret is not there), the key will be dropped from the yaml

    ... + if/elses, for things like which env-name to use for preprod vs. development deployments

- default timeout: 360 minutes (6 hours)

- Random, good workflow examples:

- when would you drop to js?
    - it is easier to log exports, warnings (using actions/core)
    - it is easier to setup conditionals w/in a chimera-job w.r.t. github variables
        - e.g. deploy to preprod, and deploy to dev
    - it is easier to do filtering logic
    - it is easier to setup curl calls
    * CON: setting up a test environment, with test payload, etc.
