To get it fully wired I need to:
- run this out of a *manual* dispatch instead
- format the message to be useful (terminate command)
- hook it up w/ devops-configuration.sh, or something, which configures who/where to send messages
- get a per-new-PR command-trigger to work
- figure out how to comment on PR's w/ GHA

Done:
- email out of GHA --> we should make an @autotiv.com account for this... maybe "devops-notifier@autotiv.com" or sth like that
- manual dispatch figured out as workflow_dispatch API

GHA: Auto-deploy ticket
- check if PR label == needsDR
- parse the ticket ID from the branch name
# * typical:
- power-up as ops-agent
- ACTIONS: configure environment (python, etc.)
- fresh deploy
# *
- get cname -- eb status
- send emails (to PM & CO)
- post PR comment, tagging PM & CO


Other Pieces:
- deploy:terminate manual switch
    "I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that.hal
    ... with an if-block and stuff
- deploy:update, commenting on PR's
    https://github.com/marketplace/actions/get-current-pull-request
- on-merge... update monday status
